# BackupHOSTS=
; Photoshop CC 2015 uses "dnssd.dll", which is Bonjour's DNS service.
; This conflicts with large HOSTS files. ie. non-stop HIGH CPU usage, lag, etc.
; If you are experiencing these symptoms, set this to "true".
; If "true", PhotoshopPortable will backup the HOSTS file to prevent this conflict.
; After PhotoshopPortable exits.. the HOSTS file is restored back to normal.

# CleanPSAutoRecover=
; Enable or disable cleanup of Photoshop's recovery files.
; Recovery files are stored at the root of designated Scratch Disk.

# ExecAsAdmin=
; Execute "Photoshop.exe" as an administrator.
; This is a last resort, should rarely be used, and only if there are problems associated with privileges.

# Junction=
; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_junction_point
; Enable or disable NTFS directory Junction points for: $COMMONFILES\Adobe, $ALLUSERSAPPDATA\Adobe.
; If disabled or incompatible, PhotoshopPortable will fall back to copying/moving directories.
